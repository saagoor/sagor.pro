Hi there! My name is Sagor and I am a software engineer with a passion for coding and a love for travelling and watching movies and series. I am a selfless and caring person who is always looking for ways to help others. I have an optimistic outlook on life and am always looking for the best in any situation.

I am an introvert and tend to be an over thinker, but I believe this allows me to approach problems with a critical and analytical mindset. With my strong technical skills and positive attitude, I am always ready to tackle complex challenges and find creative solutions. Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me.
